      Hi! I’m Paul Poleon Jr — an Industrial Engineering student at the University at Buffalo with an interest in solving problems,
      improving systems, and making things work better in the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m naturally curious about how things operate — whether that’s a workflow, a team dynamic, or a real-world process — and I love
      turning that curiosity into practical improvements.

    <p>
      I didn’t start in Industrial Engineering — I originally began in Mechanical Engineering. I enjoyed the technical side,
      especially 3D modeling, but a big shift happened when I worked as an Advanced Repair Agent with Geek Squad.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that role, I wasn’t just fixing devices. I was diagnosing real problems, communicating clearly with customers, managing time,
      and finding practical solutions under pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      That experience made something click: I was most interested in how systems and people work together — not just the mechanics.
      Switching to Industrial Engineering ended up being one of the best decisions I’ve made, and I’ve been more engaged and motivated ever since.

      I enjoy breaking down complex problems, analyzing data, and building improvements that make a real difference.
      I’m especially drawn to work where the solution has to be both technically sound and realistic for the people using it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through coursework and projects, I’ve built skills in process mapping, data analysis, and continuous improvement —
      and I’m excited to apply those skills in internships and real-world settings.

      Outside of academics, I really value leadership, teamwork, and connection with others. I earned my Eagle Scout rank after years of
      dedication and service, and I served as Senior Patrol Leader for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leading my troop meant organizing activities, working closely with both scouts and adult leaders, and learning how to bring different
      personalities together toward a shared goal. Those experiences strengthened my communication, responsibility, and ability to collaborate —
      and they’ve translated directly into how I work in engineering teams.

      Sports have played a big role in my life — I played football as a lineman and lacrosse as a goalie.
      Those positions taught me to see the bigger picture, anticipate problems before they happen, and stay calm under pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      After high school, I came back to help coach, and I loved mentoring players, building teamwork, and helping others grow both on and off the field.
      I’m still a huge football fan — I love watching games, debating plays, and keeping up with stats and highlights.
      Come Sunday, you’ll probably find me at a tailgate or glued to a TV screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not studying or watching football, I’m usually hanging out with friends or playing video games. I enjoy the strategy and competition,
      and I think they’ve helped sharpen my ability to think critically and adapt quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all, I’m a very social person who thrives in team environments with open communication. Technical skills matter —
      but I believe the ability to work well with others is what really separates a good engineer from a great one.

      Thanks for taking the time to learn a little about me. Feel free to explore my projects, experience, and resume —
      I’m always open to new opportunities and conversations.
