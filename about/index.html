          <h1>About</h1>
          <p class="muted">
           Hi! I’m Paul Poleon Jr, an Industrial Engineering student at the University at Buffalo with interests in solving problems, improving systems, and overall making things work better in the real world.
I didn’t always start out in Industrial Engineering; I actually originally began my studies in Mechanical Engineering. While I truly enjoyed the technical aspects, especially the 3D modeling, my experience as an Advanced Repair Agent with Geek Squad really shaped my perspective. In this role, I wasn’t just fixing devices; I was actually diagnosing real problems, communicating with customers, managing time effectively, and finding practical solutions to fix these problems under pressure. This experience helped me realize that I was more drawn to how systems and people work together rather than just the technical mechanics of things. Switching to Industrial Engineering has been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made, and I’ve been more engaged and motivated in my work ever since.
I’ve always been curious about how things operate, whether that’s a workflow, a team dynamic, or a real-world process. This constant curiosity is what continues to drive me in Industrial Engineering. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, analyzing data, and finding practical solutions that make a real-world difference. Through my coursework and projects, I’ve developed skills in process mapping, data analysis, and continuous improvement, and I’m excited to apply them in internships and real-world settings.
Outside of academics, I am someone who truly values leadership, teamwork, and connection with others. I earned my Eagle Scout rank after years of dedication and service to my community. During my time in the Boy Scouts, I also served as Senior Patrol Leader for many years, during which I led my troop, organized activities, and worked very closely with both scouts and the adult leaders. These experiences strengthened my leadership skills, sense of responsibility, and ability to work with a wide variety of personalities. These qualities have directly translated into my engineering career and the teamwork that comes along with it. 
Sports have also played a big role in my life. I played both football and lacrosse growing up, as a lineman in football and a goalie in lacrosse. Those positions forced me to see the bigger picture of how a team functions, anticipate the problems that we are going to face before they even happened, and stay calm under pressure. As a lineman, I had to understand how every piece of a play worked together, and as a goalie, I was constantly reading patterns, reacting quickly, and communicating with my team. Over time, I realized that I truly enjoyed seeing how different parts of the team interact and making adjustments to improve our chances of success, this naturally drew me toward engineering and eventually Industrial Engineering. 
After graduating from high school, I was offered a chance to come back to my high school and help coach the team. During my time with the team, I enjoyed mentoring the players, building teamwork, and helping others develop both on and off the field. I’m still a huge football fan today, I love watching games, debating plays with friends, and keeping up with stats and highlights. So come Sunday you’ll be sure to either find me at a tailgate or glued to a TV screen!
When I’m not studying, watching football, or hanging out with friends, you’ll likely find me playing video games. I enjoy the strategy, competition, and problem-solving that come with them, and I think that they’ve helped sharpen my ability to think critically and adapt quickly.
Above all, I am a very social person who enjoys being around others and building strong relationships. I thrive in team environments, especially those with open communication, and I genuinely enjoy meeting new people. I believe that technical skills are important, but the ability to work well with others is what truly differentiates a good engineer from a great one!
Thanks for taking the time to learn a little about me. Feel free to explore my projects, experience, and resume to see more of what I’ve been working on. I’m always open to new opportunities and conversations, so don’t hesitate to reach out!
